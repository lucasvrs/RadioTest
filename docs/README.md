# Radio Sim

This project is a simple radio simulation.

## Challenges

In order to develop this simulation, I had to tackle numerous challenges.

- developing in java
  * i've got very little experience programming in java
  * i don't know how to structure a project in java
- creating a gui using javafx
  * never used javafx --> whole new framework to learn
- using maven
  * never used maven before
- time

## Development

In order to create the gui faster, the application scenebuilder was used. It is an open source tool developed for creating javafx ui's.

The simulation should be able to display different types of radios. Therefore, a json file was used as simple "database" to provide an easy to read interface between computer and user. Moreover, it is extandable.
